# Javascript Basics

What's Javascript? It's a programming language designed for making web pages fancy, fast and most importantly, dynamic.

## Workshop Goals
- Interacting with the DOM
- Onclick: Working with functions 
- Data: Variables and Storage

_What you need:_
- Text editor (Atom is free)
- Chrome or Firefox browser
- Optional: Codepen.io account

The Codepen account simply  makes it easy for you to have working code samples. Think of it as a code notebook of sorts filled with live, working examples of designs and tricks.

All code is available right here. See the wiki for more information.
