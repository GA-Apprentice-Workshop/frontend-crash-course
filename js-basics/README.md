# Javascript Basics

What's Javascript? It's a programming language designed for making web pages fancy, fast and most importantly, dynamic.

## Workshop Goals
- Interacting with the DOM
- Onclick: Working with functions 
- Data: Variables and Storage

_What you need:_
- Text editor (Atom is free)
- Chrome or Firefox browser
- Optional: Codepen.io account

The Codepen account simply  makes it easy for you to have working code samples. Think of it as a code notebook of sorts filled with live, working examples of designs and tricks.

## Workshop Structure
There are a few key things you pay attention to:

- Lesson titles: They indicate what stage in the web development process we're working in. These will not always be in order, but you can check out the wiki to understand them better.
- Time: The time noted next to each lesson is how long it took professionals like myself to complete the task.
- Challenges: These are intended for people with working knowledge of web development.

Since everyone will have different levels of knowledge about web development, the goal was to make it easier to find your place in the course and tke advantage of each lesson.

## Reference Material
Programming languages, like all others, is best with reference tools at hand (like dictionaries or spellcheckers). It takes years to memorize and know the information well, so open the following tools in separate tabs so you have them at hand.

- [Javascript MDN Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

All code is available right here. See the wiki for more information.

# You're here because ...

### "I'm a project manager/part of a leadership team and I want to better understand how web developers do their job."

For the most part, you should take notes and ask as many questions as you need about process, difficulty and task duration. Focus less on how to actually do anything and more on trying to understand the process of of development.

Here's what you should do during the course:
- Note the different processes/stages of developing a feature.
- Try to keep the overall goal in mind when comparing the various stages.
- Note the order of development and keep in mind that in a professional setting there is much more going on, such as prototyping and testing.
- Pay attention to the amount of code it takes to do even something you previously thought to be a small or simple thing.
- Note whatever we want to do on our page, we have to define _every_ single detail or else it breaks or becomes insecure.
- Not the amount of time it takes us to perform any given task. Specifically note the "Time" factor you see next to each lesson. That is how long it took me, a knowledgable developer, to create that.
- Browse the MDN and pay special attention to the sheer volume of concepts, tools, and resources listed there.

These things will give you a stronger idea of what your team is dealing with when given tasks. During this accelerated workshop, you can learn about the different processes of development and their typical chronology.

### "I'm thinking about a career in web development."

This will be a very whirlwind crash course for you! Set your expectations reasonably. Today you should walk out of here with:

- Working examples of popular web development concepts.
- A collection of code samples to reference in your studies.
- An understanding of the overall process of development.

 Here's what you should try to do:
- Save all working code snippets you produce. When they work, save it and make a working-copy to continue experimentation with.
- Use the MDN. When you don't know what something is, look it up right away or ask the class.
- Focus on one or two things you find especially interesting. For the rest, try to understand their relationship to those things that interest you.
- Make your code work at all costs. It's not important that's pretty or optimal -- it will NOT be pretty or optimal in the professional sense. Focus your energy on understanding how to make things work. The rest will come as you continue to improve your understanding of web development.

### "I'm already familiar with the very basics of web development and I'm hoping to get a greater depth of understanding."

Awesome! As this is a crash course, the focus is on keeping things simple and out of the weeds. You will want to focus less on the things you know and more on the things you came to learn more about.

- If you're already familiar with the current lesson, keep an eye out for new information while you ask questions that dig deeper into the content.
- Complete the advanced challenges. All of them. This is what you came for!
- If someone asks a question you know the answer to, volunteer to answer it! This will challenge your understanding and validate your knowledge.
