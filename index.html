                <p>This will be a whirlwind crash course such as you've never seen! The workshop is highly compressed and designed to equip you with: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A high level understanding of web development.</li>
                    <li>Creating an HTML/CSS page.</li>
                    <li>Learn a few JS and CSS tricks and effects for dynamic pages!</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Learning to create webpages and add scripting takes a lot more work than it may seem, but it's something most people can learn in an afternoon. Lessons ahead will raise more questions than can be answered in 4 hours, but you should try to ask them any way as you explore your work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lessons are broken down into tiny projects, where at the end of each one you'll have learned to create a new element of your website. We'll bring them all together at the end. When you leave you should have a website filled with live, working examples of how to make things work. That ill serve as the basis of your continued learning and exploration of web development.
