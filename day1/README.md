**HTTP and the Client/Server model**

- Every machine on the internet is a client or a server
- They speak to each other through HTTP
- A client/server "conversation" is known as the Request/Response cycle 	
	- Demo with Chrome Dev Tools
<br>
	
- How does front-end development fit in?
	- What does a front-end developer do?
	- Difference between front-end and back-end?
	- Goals of FEWD
		- Accessability, usability, performance
	- What tools and technologies are used?
		- Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
		- Tools: Git, Sublime, Chrome Developer Tools
		- More: SASS
<br>

- Benefits of Designers knowing HTML and CSS, and maybe even JS
	- Add to existing website 
	- Work with Axure-generated HTML, CSS, and JS

The Internet
-
- Let's give ourselves a backdrop
- TCP/IP, Domains (270 million!), Clients and Servers	
- HTTP - a Client/Server protocol, request *resources*
	- With some exceptions (e.g. web sockets), client always initializes interaction
		
HTML
-
- Elements, tags, attributes, commenting, common elements
- DOM structure
	- Node - Branch - Parent/Child elements
- 
- something else
- Axure to HTML



CSS
-

- Properties, Rules, Selectors, syntax
- Including with HTML, Sources
- "Cascading" -> Specificity
	- "Competing" might be more appropriate
	- With CSS coming from different sources, more than one stylesheet rule may apply to a given HTML element.  How does the page know which one to apply?  Answer: The one that is more *specific*
	- Different sources?
		- Author, user (if page style can be dynamically changed based on user input), CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap), browser (may or may not be an *actual* stylesheet)
- Pseudo-classes
- Box Model
- External vs. internal vs. inline, priority, "Separation of Concerns"
- "Computed"?
- Layout: Display and Position properties
- What is "responsive" design?
- Power UP with SASS
