{"name":"Frontend Crash Course","tagline":"A 4 hour virtuoso of learning web development!","body":"### Welcome to the Frontend Crash Course\r\nWith only 4 hours available, this course is designed to do just two things:\r\n1 - Teach you how to get a basic website going.\r\n2 - Enjoy our time doing it.\r\n\r\nIt seems so easy to scare people away from web development by touting all the different languages there are to learn, and showing off code snippets that obscure the real magic of web development. By the end of this course, hopefully you'll see it as even more exciting and interesting than you did coming in.\r\n\r\nKeep in touch with your instructor if you'd like to continue learning about web development after the course.\r\n\r\nPart I: HTML\r\nPart II: CSS\r\nPart III: The Nitty Gritty\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
